            <pre>
                 The Great Wall developed from the disparate border fortifications and castles of individual Chinese kingdoms. 
                For several centuries these kingdoms probably were as concerned with protection from their near neighbours as they were with the threat of barbarian invasions or raids.

           <pre>
                The ruins of the ancient city Petra are in southwest Jordan. Petra was built on a terrace, pierced from east to west by the Wadi Mūsā (the Valley of Moses). 
                 Petra is called in Arabic Baṭrā, and it was once a center of an Arab kingdom in Hellenistic and Roman times.

           <pre>
            The Taj Mahal is a mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. 
            It is considered the finest example of Mughal architecture (a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles). The Taj Mahal is also one of the world’s most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. 
            The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

           <pre>
            Rome's, if not Italy's, most enduring icon is undoubtedly its Colosseum.
            Built between A.D. 70 and 80 A.D., it was in use for some 500 years.

        <center><img src="img4.jfif"width="300"heigth="300"></center>
           <pre>
            The Art Deco-style Christ the Redeemer statue has been towering over Brazilians from upon Corcovado mountain in an awe-inspiring state of eternal blessing since 1931. 
            The 130-foot reinforced concrete-and-soapstone statue was designed by Heitor da Silva Costa and cost approximately $250,000 to build — much of the money was raised through donations.
